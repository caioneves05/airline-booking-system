I have added `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore` file.

Regarding `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, it is generally not recommended to add these files to `.gitignore` in a Node.js project.

*   `package.json` contains project metadata, scripts, and a list of dependencies. It's essential for defining your project and allowing others to understand and set it up.
*   `package-lock.json` (or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` for older npm versions) locks down the exact versions of all dependencies, ensuring consistent installations across different environments.

Ignoring these files would make it very difficult for other developers to install the correct dependencies and set up the project. Are you sure you want to ignore `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, and if so, could you please explain your use case?
